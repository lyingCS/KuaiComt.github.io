*KuaiComt* is a comprehensive short video recommendation dataset that includes abundant comment text and interaction data. It contains real user behavior logs collected from the short-video mobile app [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/en), a leading short video app in China with over 400 million daily active users. On average, users spend over 120 minutes on the app each day, with more than 7 minutes (over 5%) spent in the video comments section. The comments section boasts a UV penetration rate of over 60%.

**This is the first recommendation dataset that not only records item text and interaction data but also includes abundant comment text and interaction data!**
